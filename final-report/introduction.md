### Project Objectives

Our company secured a contract for a local council in Victoria to re-surface roads in a designated kilometre area. The objectives are to design, implement, test and deliver a system that will perform these calculations and display the result to the user.

### Requirements

We are to use Google Maps and related products and any satellite/aerial views. The project involves writing the related code, with an elegant GUI to support calculations. (Paplinski, 2018, p. 2)

### Constraints
We have the following constraints on the project:

- Only have access to publicly available data.
- Limited to available information online.
- No / Limited access to council records.
- The project must be finalised by the end of week 12.
