## Method

* [ ] explain the methodology used in your project - provide technical details.
* [ ] internal design: description of how the parts of the final completed
      project are meant to work together (e.g. sequence diagrams, use-case,
      package overview, etc.)
* [ ] software architecture: overall structure of the code; high-level structure
      (if any) of the final completed project. Consider including class diagrams
      if you’re using an OO programming language.
* [ ] also, elaborate on key algorithms/functions/formulae used – pseudocode,
      flowcharts, etc.
* [ ] statistics (\*if your project deals with raw statistics incl.
      simulations.) -- What statistics are collected and how they are output.
