\section{Introduction}
% TODO: Add starting Introduction

\subsection{Project Objectives}

Out company secured a contract for a local council in Victoria to resurface
roads in a designated square kilometre area. The objectives are to design,
implement, test and deliver a system that will perform these calculations and
display the result to the user.

\subsection{Requirements}

We are to use Google Maps and related products and any satellite/aerial views.
The project involves writing the related code, with an elegant GUI to support
calculations. \autocite[2]{intro:1}

\subsection{Constraints}

We have the following constrains on the project:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Only have access to publicly available data.
  \item Limited to available information online.
  \item No/Limited access to council records.
  \item The project must be finalised by the end of week 12.
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}
% Background
% include a review of academic literature used when preparing for the project.
% any research leading up to enabling the current project to happen (e.g.
% current literature, existing case studies, existing studies)
% datasets used in your current project, including any academic literature on the background of the dataset (e.g. a paper by the dataset's authors or info on how it was made)
% project info: main project risks, their probabilities and risk reduction strategies, risks actually encountered
% resource requirements (hardware and software)
% tasks required and their dependency relations in producing the final project; as well as a timeline of the final completed project.

\subsection{Project Info}
% TODO: Add section intro.

\subsubsection{Project Risks}

We have identified the main project risks and their probability.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cannot find appropriate road data for calculations. (Medium)
  \item Cannot access data from the OpenStreetMap API.\@ (Low)
  \item Google Maps API offline. (Low)
  \item Problems with infrastructure. (Low)
  \item Completing the project on-time. (Medium)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Risk Reduction Strategies}

Using the following risk reduction strategies we have been able to reduce these
risks and lower their probability.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Research sources for street data from various sources.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Google Maps did not provide enough data to be useful.
      \item OpenStreetMap provided the required data and an API to access it.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Planning out the project; breaking it up into small components that can
    be worked on sequentially in a short period of time.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Risks Encountered}

The following issues arose throughout the project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Finding data sources
  \item Finding time to complete the project while working full time and
    completing assessments for other subjects.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resource Requirements}
% TODO: Add subsection intro.

\subsubsection{Hardware}

We have decided to use as much Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a
Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions to keep costs
down. \autocite[4]{project-spec:2}

\paragraph{Backend}

To host the backend API, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been chosen due to its
comprehensive free tier and prior experience with the platform. Integration with
the platform is handled by the Serverless framework \autocite{serverless:3}. The
following AWS services have been used:

\begin{itemize}
  \item AWS Lambda
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Functions as a Service (FaaS).
      \item Allows running backend code without maintaining server
        infrastructure \autocite{aws:4}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item AWS API Gateway --- Allows creating public API endpoints for Lambda
    functions \autocite{aws:5}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Frontend}

To host the frontend application, we have chosen Netlify \autocite{netlify:6},
it provides free services to open source projects. This includes a CDN, static
file hosting and automatic deployments from CI/CD providers.

\paragraph{Other Services}



\subsubsection{Software}

\subsection{Tasks}

\section{Method}
% Method
% explain the methodology used in your project - provide technical details.
% internal design: description of how the parts of the final completed project are meant to work together (e.g. sequence diagrams, use-case, package overview, etc.)
% software architecture: overall structure of the code; high-level structure (if any) of the final completed project. Consider including class diagrams if you’re using an OO programming language.
% also, elaborate on key algorithms/functions/formulae used – pseudocode, flowcharts, etc.
% statistics (*if your project deals with raw statistics incl. simulations.) -- What statistics are collected and how they are output.

\section{Results}
% Results
% This is the major new contribution in the report. In general, it is for you to analyse the outcomes (and quality) of the project.
% What sort of results or output were obtained with your program?
% If your project itself contains original research, elaborate on that as well.
% If your project deals with experimental statistics/case studies, kindly note the following points:
% describe the experiments performed;
% the statistics/outputs collected;
% Externally observable features of your software/simulation: input, output.
% Performance: include time and space performance characteristics of your software as well as estimated complexities (including real-world processing time, storage space, bandwidth, etc.)

\section{Analysis \& Discussion}
% Analysis & Discussion
% analyse those statistics/outputs.
% e.g. statistics-based project: results/outcomes for statistical tests on your data; evaluate the quality of your output; what statistics were collected under what circumstances.
% e.g. qualitative project/based on case studies: what case study is chosen; what is the motivation behind such a study; your experimental outcomes; critiques on the outcome; comment on existing studies; also literature/sources that back up your claims.
% Report how the statistics/outputs support or undermine the main hypotheses behind this project. What hypotheses were supported/disconfirmed by the data?
% If you don’t have any idea how this kind of research might be reported, look at a few research articles in the journal JASSS: http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/JASSS.html

\section{Future Work}
% Future work: Include also any possible future research that might emanate from the project.

\section{Conclusion}

\section{Bibliography}

\printbibliography{}

\section{Appendices}
% Appendices. Including, as advised by your supervisor:
% Production and Deployment [IMPORTANT]: detailed instructions to run/install/compile your software, with complete instructions/screenshots. Include ALL information such as dependencies, platform, etc.
% Parameters used, their ranges. If GUIs were used: GUI features used for them (e.g. input boxes, choices, etc...) If a command interface was used: parameters, switches, arguments, etc.
% User Interface: How to run the software (be as specific as possible). Any other functions made available to the user (incl. screenshots of the various features "at work" with sample data). Also, for WWW-based services/appliances - detail clearly the interface(s) to your Web-based project.
% Any externally available functions not covered above (including debugging tools, auxilliary/helper functions, bonus features...
% Internal testing procedures implemented including cross-references to your Test Report (which is submitted separately)
% etc.
